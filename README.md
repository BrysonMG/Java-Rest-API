# Java-Rest-API
A simple CRUD / RESTful API built with Java, Maven, and Springboot

#### The only purpose of this API is to serve as a reference while I get used to making RESTful APIs in Java.

## Quick Setup

> Go to the [Spring Initializr](start.spring.io) (not a typo), which will generate a new project with the Spring framework installed. You can also add dependencies here; for this basic API, the only dependency used was Spring Web.
> Once the project has been generated, you can open it with your preferred IDE.

## Notes

> In order for this code to function properly, you need to have some kind of server and database to connect to. There is a file not included in this repo located in `src > main > resources` called `application.properties` which holds the URL and login information for the data source chosen, as well as many other possible settings. Given that this file contains a password, it obviously needed to be ignored despite being required for this code to actually do something.
