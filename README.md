# Java-Rest-API
A simple CRUD / RESTful API built with Java, Maven, and Springboot

### The only purpose of this API is to serve as a reference while I get used to making RESTful APIs in Java.

## Quick Setup

> Go to the [Spring Initializr](start.spring.io) (not a typo), which will generate a new project with the Spring framework installed. You can also add dependencies here; for this basic API, the only dependency used was Spring Web.
> Once the project has been generated, you can open it with your preferred IDE.
